# Lost Rooms of Purdue

The purpose of this project is to offer the player a virtual reality escape room experience while
incorporating atmospheric themes. Gameplay will be similar to the game The Room and reallife escape rooms. In order to offer the user a more challenging and unique experience there will
be an AI deemed the “Puzzle-master”, similar to GLADOS from the game Portal, who’s role
will be to control the world in which the player solves puzzles, create random puzzle solutions,
and interfere with the player’s puzzle solving process. The puzzles that the player will face will
vary but will all revolve around the use of in-game physics and the player’s ability to grab and
manipulate objects.
